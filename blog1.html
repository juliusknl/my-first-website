        <h1>What the hell is going on?</h1>
        <p>
            To be honest, I couldn’t imagine a great many things that are more painful to watch than the last presidential debate. Thank god I anticipated the disaster and got drunk during the show, or I might have actually smashed my Screen in half. Who doesn’t like to watch a debate between 2 old white dudes, one who brings up his golf skills as the best argument for his being the most powerful man in the world, and the other not even being able to remember which year he is living in, while he already is the most powerful man alive.</p>
            
            <p>I don’t think anybody has ever witnessed anything like this. Well, maybe Biden and Trump themselves, given that they’re so fucking old. Sure, I grew up in Germany, where political drama hasn’t exactly been the norm recently - we did have the same chancellor for 16 consecutive years after all. But even to the most politically experienced Americans, those that have witnessed Bush steal an election and then invade the wrong nation for some reason, Clinton sleeping with his secretary or behold - a black guy voted into office; even those people must be crying in their sleep right now. Even as a foreigner it’s hard to stomach what is going on in the US and nothing seems to be certain but one thing: the country has already lost. People are loosing trust in democracy. And honestly, who can blame them? It’s not easy to make an argument for this democracy when the best candidates it can produce are a lying and self-obsessed narcissist and a dementia patient. I mean seriously… that’s the best you’ve got? </p>
            
            <p>And while this is bad, it would be something one could overlook if we lived in 2010 and could hope for a new breeze of fresh air after a presidency that won’t make a big impact. The problem is, that whoever is president will make choices regarding two major wars and shape a economic and diplomatic landscape in a way that is likely to last - and yet, instead of talking about policies all Trump and Biden do is cast blame. </p>
