            I don’t think anybody has ever witnessed anything like this election year. Well, except maybe Biden and Trump themselves, given that they’re so fucking old. </p>
            <p>To be honest, I couldn’t imagine a great many things that are more painful to watch than the last presidential debate. Thank god I anticipated the disaster and got drunk during this comedy show, or I might have actually smashed my screen. I mean, when you look at it, the setup seems pretty straight forward: Because Trump has basically taken over the Republicans, even the pretty strong opposition from within the party couldn’t prevent his nomination. But there’s a problem: His approval ratings are… not the best. While watching this comedy show of a debate, me and probably many others literally wanted to break everything in their studio because he apparently has an allergy against telling the truth and really wants people to believe that Biden’s plan is to „rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby“.</p>

            <p>This makes it fairly easy for democrats, one could say. Basically all they needed to do was to put up a candidate who is</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>alive,</li>
                    <li>knows how to speak and</li>
                    <li>is maybe not an old white dude. (This one is not even strictly necessary)</li>
                </ul>
                
               <p> And yet, they somehow managed to pull off a miracle and make Trump seem like a viable candidate by deciding to run Biden, who has not only forgotten how to form coherent sentences, but apparently also doesn’t have a team to tell him he should close his mouth while not speaking during a debate. </p>
            
            <p>I know I can’t vote, but I feel sorry for everyone who can. Sure, I grew up in Germany, where political drama hasn’t exactly been the norm recently - we did have the same chancellor for 16 consecutive years after all. But even the most politically experienced Americans, those that have witnessed Bush steal an election and then invade the wrong nation for some weird reason, Clinton sleeping with his secretary or behold - a black guy voted into office; even those people must be crying in their sleep right now. It seems like only one thing is certain: the country has already lost. Is that really what democracy in the greatest country of the world is supposed to look like? </p>
            <p>The way I see it, democrats only have one chance at winning: Biden needs to step down immediately and dems need to rally behind another candidate at the same time. I pray it happens, but this doesn’t seem likely right now. Even if Biden were to step down, I firmly hope that he has the foresight to demand a candidate be ready for when he does. Because while Kamala Harris would be the logical nominee in line, she is so unpopular that already democrats are pushing several other people in the conversation for nominee. And if they can’t agree to put country before individual success there would likely be a power struggle for the candidacy within the party once more… and as we know, politicians are always out for the greater good, haha. </p>
            <p>While past actions suggest otherwise, one can only hope the democrats can pull themselves together and make rational decisions by acting quickly and like a unified party - even if it hurts. If not now, when?
